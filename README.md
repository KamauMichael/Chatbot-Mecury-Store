# Chatbot-Mecury-Store

This project consists of a chatbot which was developed for Mecury store.

In total, four files are responsible for ensuring the chatbot is functonal. They are:

a) index.html - This file is responsible for displaying the store webpage.

b) main.py - All major python functions and libraries (flask,pairs and nltk.chat,util)
                  are contained here. 

c) pairs.py - Responses for both end users and chatbot itself are located here.

d) style.css - It enhances the webpage so as to make it presentable.

The goal of this project was to simulate a customer interaction with a chatbot.

However, responses given by chatbot are user depedent. If a random request is entered, it gives this output:
'Sorry,I don't understand that. Could you re-enter your request ?'
